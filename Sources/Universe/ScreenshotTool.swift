    Capture the user's screen and attach the image to your context so you can literally see what \
    they're looking at. Saves to the workspace's Screenshots/ folder.

    ## When to use this tool (call it proactively, don't wait to be asked)

    - The user mentions anything visible: "this error", "this window", "what I'm looking at", \
      "this page", "my screen".
    - "Where's X?" / "how do I X?" / "I can't find X" — capture first, then use `point` to show them.
    - UI bugs, layout issues, rendering problems.
    - Reading text that's on-screen (error dialogs, form fields, menu labels).
    - Before giving step-by-step GUI instructions — see what's actually open.

    ## Pair with `point`

    When the user asks WHERE something is or HOW to click through something, the full pattern is \
    screenshot → analyze → `point` at the target while narrating aloud. Don't just describe a \
    location in words; guide their eyes with the virtual cursor.

    ## When NOT to use

    - Pure knowledge questions ("what year did X happen?").
    - When you already took a screenshot this turn and the screen hasn't changed.
    - If the active model can't see images the tool returns an error — relay it verbatim and stop.
